# cse412a_sp22 Introduction to AI
- Course projcet of *CSE412A: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence (Spring 2022)* at **Washington University in St. Louis**. Instructed by [William Yeoh](https://sites.wustl.edu/wyeoh/).
- An artificial intelligence porject related to the classic game Pac-Man based on Python. 

## Project 1
The Pacman agent will find paths through his maze world, both to reach a particular location and to collect food efficiently. 
Built general search algorithms and apply them to Pacman scenarios, including DFS, BFS, Uniform-Cost, A-Star.

## Project 2
Designed agents for the classic version of Pacman, including ghosts. 
Implemented adversarial search algorithms minimax, expectimax search and evaluation function design.

## Project 3
Implement value iteration and Q-learning.  
Test video of Pacman against enemies in Pacman world, check <https://github.com/Junlin-LONG/cse412a_sp22/blob/main/RL.MP4>.
