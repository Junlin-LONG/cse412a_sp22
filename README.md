# cse412a_sp22: Introduction to AI
An artificial intelligence porject related to the classic game Pac-Man based on Python

# Project 1
The Pacman agent will find paths through his maze world, both to reach a particular location and to collect food efficiently. 
Built general search algorithms and apply them to Pacman scenarios, including DFS, BFS, Uniform-Cost, A-Star.

# Project 2
Designed agents for the classic version of Pacman, including ghosts. 
Implemented adversarial search algorithms: minimax, expectimax search and evaluation function design.

# Project 3
Implement value iteration and Q-learning. 
Test video of Pacman against enemies in Pacman world, check <https://github.com/Junlin-LONG/cse412a_sp22/blob/main/reinforcement%20learning.mp4>.
